Emotion Detection project is a deep learning system that recognizes human emotions. This system could prove essential as facial emotions play a vital role in human interactions and could be beneficial in creating empathetic AI systems. This project stands as a foundation to such systems.

Using the Kaggle facial emotion dataset, the convolution neural network is trained. The trained system then detects facial emotions.

To set up this project, follow these steps:
 1. Clone or fork the project.
 2. Install Python libraries including keras (with tensorflow as the backend), OpenCV, numpy, pandas, matplotlib.
 3. Use a Kaggle API to access and download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview.
 4. Run the notebook file in Google Colab, a cloud-based notebook IDE that allows free GPU usage.
